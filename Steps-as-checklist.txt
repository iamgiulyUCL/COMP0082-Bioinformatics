✓ Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Defining Your Approach
- Goal: Predict the subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins into five categories: Cytosolic, Extracellular/Secreted, Nuclear, Mitochondrial, and Other.
- Model Requirements:
    - Output a predicted category with a confidence measure (High, Medium, Low).
    - Perform cross-validation and assess accuracy, F1-score, and MCC.
- Model Selection:
    - Choose an appropriate model (e.g., neural networks, SVMs, decision trees).
    - Start with simple models like decision trees or logistic regression.
    - Consider interpretability using methods like decision trees or feature importance techniques.

Step 2: Feature Engineering
- Extract Features from Protein Sequences:
    - Sequence Length
    - Amino Acid Composition (overall and local)
    - Isoelectric Point & Molecular Weight
    - Sequence Motifs
- Encode Protein Sequences:
    - Convert sequences into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding, PSSM, embeddings like ProtBERT).
    - Use basic features like amino acid frequencies or physicochemical properties for traditional ML approaches.
- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and prepare data.
    - Normalize or standardize numerical features if required.

Step 3: Model Selection and Training
- Split data into training and validation sets.
- Train the model using engineered features.
- Use Scikit-learn for traditional models or TensorFlow/PyTorch for neural networks.
- Tune hyperparameters using grid search or random search.

Step 4: Confidence Estimation
- Generate confidence scores:
    - Use probability of the predicted class for SVMs or decision trees.
    - Use softmax layer output for neural networks.
- Classify Confidence:
    - Define thresholds for confidence levels (e.g., >0.8 = High, 0.5-0.8 = Medium, ≤0.5 = Low).

Step 5: Evaluate Your Model
- Evaluate performance using:
    - Accuracy (ACC)
    - F1-Score
    - Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
    - Confusion Matrix
- Perform ablation studies to analyze feature importance (optional).

Step 6: Final Predictions on Challenge Test Set
- Test on the "blind" challenge set.
- Predict subcellular location and confidence score for each protein.
- Format results as specified in the coursework description.

Step 7: Write the Report
- Introduction:
    - Describe the problem and its importance.
    - Introduce subcellular locations and task goal.
- Methodology:
    - Explain chosen model and feature derivation.
    - Describe training process and evaluation metrics.
- Results:
    - Present model results with graphs and tables.
    - Include blind test set results with confidence levels.
- Discussion:
    - Interpret results and analyze model performance.
    - Discuss strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.
- Conclusion:
    - Summarize findings and suggest future work.
- Appendix (optional):
    - Include supplementary materials (e.g., technical summary of code).

Step 8: Submit the Coursework
- Finalize the report (around 2500 words).
- Prepare code and data for submission.
- Ensure reproducibility without an internet connection.
- Submit report and code as per guidelines.
