# COMP0082 Coursework V2.02: Predicting the Subcellular Location of Proteins

## Overview

This project is part of a coursework for the Bioinformatic Module @ UCL. It is developed during the MSc Artificial Intelligence for Biomedicine and Healthcare.
The work involves developing a machine learning model to predict the subcellular location of eukaryotic protein sequences. The goal is to classify proteins into five categories:

- **Cytosolic**
- **Extracellular/Secreted**
- **Nuclear**
- **Mitochondrial**
- **Other**

## Objective

Develop a model that classifies protein sequences into the above categories.

## Data

The protein sequences are provided in **Fasta format** and categorized with the above classes, one file for each class.

A **blinded challenge set** with 20 sequences will also be provided for final testing.
